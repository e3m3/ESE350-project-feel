Embedded Systems
Programs for an m2 and mbed microcontroller. Haptic feedback is passed between the two controllers over a zigbee connection. A gyrometer mounted on a stick allows us to capture motion data of the stick and use that data to determine orientation and location of the user's sword arm. This is fed into a python program that provides the ability to activate connected actuators accordingly.
