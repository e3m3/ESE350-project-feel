#   ProjectFEEL

University of Pennsylvania Embedded Systems ([ESE350][1] [[1]]) Final Project.

Programs for an [m2][2] [[2]] and [mbed][3] [[3]] microcontroller.
Haptic feedback is passed between the two controllers over a zigbee connection.
A gyrometer mounted on a stick allows us to capture motion data of the stick and use that data to determine orientation and location of the user's sword arm.
This is fed into a python program that provides the ability to activate connected actuators accordingly.

##  Demo

Watch the ProjectFEEL demo on [YouTube][4] [[4]].
